#Integration of CAHM with your ONE simulator setup

1) Overwrite DTNHost.java in your setup with the DTNHost.java included in this project. 
OR 
If you have made any changes in your DTNHost.java then you will not able to overwrite the file. In that case, just copy lines 80 to 85 from the DTNHost.java of this project to your DTNHost.java at the appropriate place.

2) Add movement/CAHM.java, movement/community.java, movement/coordinate.java and movement/overlap.java in movement/ folder of your setup

3) Add core/powerLawRNG.java and core/powerLawRNG1.java in core/ folder of your setup

4) Add report/CommunityStructureReport.java in report/ folder of your setup

#Community Structure Report

"CommunityStructureReport" reports overlapping community structure generated by CAHM.
