(2010) mobility model. CAHM achieves heterogeneous local popularity as observed in real mobility traces which HHW fails to achieve. It also incorporates following additional properties of human mobility: preference of nearby locations, speed as a function of distance to be traveled and power-law distributed pause time. We show that these properties make significant impact on routing protocolsâ€™ performance. We also propose methods based on mathematical models to identify popular nodes within community (hubs) and in entire network (gateways) from overlapping community structure itself without doing message flooding.\r\n  \r\nKeywords: Mobility model; Mobile social network; Overlapping community structure; Heterogeneous popularity; Hub and gateway\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-48296645-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
